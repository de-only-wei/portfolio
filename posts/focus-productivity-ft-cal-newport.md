Today I tried to listen to a podcast while working and I've realized Im a terrible multitasker... It was taking forever to make progress on work (integrating GraphQL to my existing API with Postman, Google Sheet and Kuali Build) so I just dropped the podcast and finish up my task first. After I proceeded so, I was able to finish my work in no time and continue the podcast.

The podcast I listened to: [the Huberman podcast ft. Dr Cal Newport](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5TAmY56aFV2J6Byn0qg94H?si=bc182bbe955c4ddf) was intriguing so I delved into it and here are some main points that I found that were interesting so I summarized them.

> Focusing on one task at a time leads to better results (for me).

# Tips
### Boosting Productivity (Whiteboarding, Streamlining Worflow, Sectioning Rooms)
Firstly, whiteboarding with a group (2-3 people) can provide *20-30%* boost in concentration. Here's why: it forces active engagement(no one wants to be left behind). Another tip is to streamline your workflow and remove any major friction point in whatever you do, eliminate the middleman for every task you tackle and you'll see major improvements in your efficiency. Sectioning your workspace also helps your mind to focus more efficiently in different zones.
### Improving your ability to retain and apply concepts (Active Recall)
Active Recall is the way to go, just rewrite from scratch after you've "learned" a new concept. This process exposes any gaps in your understanding, allowing you to solidify your knowledge before moving on.

### Deep Work (Disconnect Distractions)
One important thing to note is that *Deep Work does not equal flow*, it will always feel hard and challenging. Another thing is to limit the amount of stimuli you are exposed to which can lead to mental exhaustion in the end.
1. Disconnect from distractions, the initial 15 minutes are extremely crucial (avoid switching tasks)
2. Avoid falling into pseudo-productivity (actions that make you feel productive but in reality are not)
### Making Boredom Tolerable (Change Activities)
All creative insights come from boredom, that's why we should embrace it and break the phone-reliance loop. We can replace or use that time to do other activites like going for a walk, hiking, cycling. The main purpose is to observe our surroundings which somehow helps to clear our mind and help stimulate learning (Gap Effects).
A reason why our phone is so addictive is because apps are now optimized for "dwell time" especially tiktok which manipulates our attention span

# Burnout & Balance (Administrative Overheads, Calls)
The main cause of Burnout is the action performed on the commitment (administrative overhead), we spend more time talking about work than actually doing work. 
One way to have balance is to use text as a way of logistics (organization) and using the phone(call) as a communication which can minimize overheads. Also, avoid timeblocking in the weekends and just let loose and chill

# Productivity Tools
### 1. Workload (pull-based system)
Once you've finished the top layer just pull new tasks from the bottom (like github projects), One interesting way is to make it public so friends or coworkers can add their task onto your workload as well
1. **Top List:** actively working on 2-3 things, only include work stuff
2. **Bottom List:** next task, ordered queue, *add different categories?*

### 2. Multiscale planning (daily, weekly, seasonally/quarterly)
fix a schedule and work around the schedule (helps to innovate and improve efficiency), and keep track on goals , obligations. Reduces mental overhead of deciding what to do next. Just follow your daily rule.
1. **seasonal(reminder for the goal of semester)**
    set goal for semester so you'll know when deadlines are coming up
2. **weekly(looking at calendar, treat week/unit )**
    refer to seasonal and create it, this is where you confront the realities of the week in relation to the goal. Make changes to your schedule annd events accordingly
3. **daily(time blocking)**
    refer to weekly plan, create blocks and assign "jobs" to them. Communication can also be a job (social media, emails, messages, etc)

### 3. Shutdown ritual (close open loops)
treat this as a review session, review and record uncompleted tasks to clear your mind. Have a phrase or something habitual(cognitive behavorial therapy) which helps with dessertation

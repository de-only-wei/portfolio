While I was feeling stuffed from feasting on a Friday night, it somehow reminded me of a particular lunch meeting with someone. There was a question that she asked while we were eating that I thought would be a funny thing to talk about.

> **She asked me:** 
>
>"*how does your wardrobe look like.*" (I did not know she was a designer until later...) 

Which I was then kinda embarrassed to say, and delayed the inevitable with some random side stories, some back and forth questions and off-topic moments. But I did tell her in the end.

> **I said:** 
>
>"*Ohh funny you asked but would you believe that my wardrobe consists of a copious amount of the same pairs of pants. Same pairs of underwear. Same pair of socks. Same kind of clothes."

She gave me the funniest look I've ever seen. She asked why, so I gave her a summary of my thoughts so...

> **I said:** 
>
>Its convenient

## Reasoning

Which I genuinely thought so. It ties back to what Dr Cal Newport said about Administrative Overhead (things that you have to do and is not productive). To me, I don't really think that clothing is so important (as long as it makes you presentable) that you need to spend time to pick and choose your outfit every morning, every activity, every outing. The only thing I would pick is what jacket/ shoe I would wear which depends on the weather (rain/shine, cold/breezy). Other than that, It should be a seamless process of grabbing changing and going. 

The same goes with food as well. I see it as a mean of sustenance now as opposed to an enjoyment. I used to mess around in the kitchen during my early college days but now I just meal prep for the whole week with Marcus every Sunday. It's a grab and go process every morning before I leave for work and classes. It's so convenient and frees up so much mental space (it's actually a game changer). But health wise it's debatable to keep food in the fridge for so long (might change to plastic containers, so I can freeze half the week)

With that said, I still do think about what to eat during the weekends or Friday nights when I can relax and chill a little from the weekday system. Sometimes all the time and energy that I've saved from these actions would be simply consumed by distractions and entertainment still. Well at least I'm still trying to make a change on that latter part.


To me these are some of the best "hacks" ( <mark>Simple Wardrobe & Meal Prepping</mark> )that I've found to help me to save time and effort and remove Administrative Overhead in my day-to-day life. 
### Remarks
To be fair, I don't have the same kind of clothes that's just an exaggeration it's organized more into like categories (daily, better, formal) which my wardrobe will be something of a list like this:

**Shirt:** 
- Daily(class, working, general daily use) used 90% of the time
- Better(special occasions)
- Formal(conferences, big events)

**Pants:** same colored Uniqlo shorts, 2 other pants(more utility)

**Socks:** white long Uniqlo socks

Then I'll just grab and go depending on that occasion.

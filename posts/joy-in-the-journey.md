### Prelude

Recently I've been trying to be more present in everything I do. What I've found out that being present makes you appreciate and enjoy each of the activities you are participating in more enjoyable. Even though the activity might not go as planned, **OR** it might cause bodily pain, **OR** it might mentally test you. It still becomes an extremely enjoyable and fun process.

I used to take cycling as a means of just going from point A to point B. It was simply just a mode of transportation not a hobby that I would enjoy doing. But recently, I've been going on long rides more often with Jason, and it's been a refreshing take on this old sport that I've been doing for 10+ years. I'll have to thank him for rekindling my love for this sport. It's just a different pace from what I've been doing in Malaysia which was just some "hardcore power through that pain" kinda sport with my dad (he is a drill sergeant when it comes to cycling).

Hiking, much the same with cycling. The experience of trekking through uneven terrains, getting your hands and shoes caked with dirt and mud, is a welcomed change from my usual routine of staring at a screen for a copious amount of time, and pumping iron. The view from the hiking trips I've been on with Dennis and his friends were always amazing.

### Afterthought

There is just something special about cycling on the side of the road, hiking through beautiful trails surrounded by the beauty of the great Californian outdoors that provides a sense of comfort and solace to me. It helps to clear my head and bring much needed space especially after so much has happened in this hectic semester. 

I guess I finally know why my dad always go on runs and rides with me when I was in Malaysia. It's a time when he can clear his mind from work and stress and bond with his son.

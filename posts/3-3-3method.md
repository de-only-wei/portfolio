**Life is busy.**<br>
The proposed 3-3-3 method tackles down tasks by following these rules: 

### 3 hours of focused work
For the most important task of the day. Has priority over everything else.<br>
*ie: assignment, projects, etc*

> You'll get more done in 3 hours of focused work than 10 hours of distracted work

### 3 urgent tasks
For urgent and less time-consuming tasks. Do the things that you have been putting off.<br>
*ie: replying emails, organizing study plan, planning project*

### 3 maintenance tasks
For nonwork, school tasks. <br>
*ie: laundry, meal prepping, chores*

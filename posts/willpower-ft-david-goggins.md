Today I listened to [Huberman's Podcast ft David Goggins](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7KUr9Yw1e1IbELsiSWtE4W?si=01c163b6a3764206). 

Something that really caught my attention was when they talked about the Anterior Midcingulate Cortex (AMCC). It is directly responsible for people's **Willpower & Will to Live**. One of the key factors to the growth of your AMCC is to: 

### Do Hard Things
In fact, the only way to grow that part is to constantly challenge yourself by doing:
- Things that are hard and full of friction
- Things that you **don't** want to do

Just as easy as you can grow your AMCC, it'll shrink as easily as it grows. That's why you constantly need to feed it with challenges and adversity. It's like a campfire and the challenges are the logs that keeps it burning.

> There are no hacks, It's you against you

### Remarks

Most often times, I precisely know the exact steps for improvement. But the difficulty of it is holding me back. 
Goggins message to tackle this issue is just so simple and powerful: *DO IT*, and *OUTWORK* what you are capable of.

One of my favorite quotes from Goggins is definitely: 
> Stay Hard (its funny and motivational)

Sometimes I still avoid challenges because doing things that you suck at, just sucks...

But recently, I've been pushing myself in doing things that I SUCK at, I DONT want to do, I AVOIDED doing. Minor inconveniences, Major challenges, Unexpected problems, Just about anything. It's like making me not fear problems anymore and gives me the courage to brave any storm headfirst. I've also found myself to be even more optimistic in every outcome as I know there will always be a way.

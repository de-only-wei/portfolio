![After Decimating a V2 (it was a struggle)](/images/v2.jpg)

I used to not understand the appeal of rock climbing and why people enjoyed this sport so much, especially a lot of software engineers. It is partially also because I'm afraid of heights and afraid of falling (Even though I live on the 23rd floor in Malaysia) I've tried rock climbing for a few times before, but it just did not click with me until today on a whim, when I went to try out rock climbing again. 

I was feeling reluctant at first after my workout (destroyed my chest, shoulders, triceps), but for some mysterious reason I just agreed to go with Jason to the rock climbing event. And boy was I happy and grateful I did because I think I've found my new favorite sport. 

It started slow at first with me struggling with V1s and barely completing V0s but as the event progressed I started to get into the groove and was able to complete V0s and V1s better. But James gave me some valuable pointers on how to improve my climb, and it helped me greatly in increasing my chances of completing these climbs

**Tips:**
- Use your legs more, rather than your arms and upper body only <br>I did not really utilize my legs prior
- Stay close to the walls, it makes it easier to propel from one hold to another <br>helps with weight distribution as well

### Cannon Event

The ***cannon event*** that got me in love with rock climbing was when I attempted a V2 graded problem (Which I've never done before). I just decided to send a V2 problem even though I couldn't even complete some V1s. It started out being ok but at the end, there was this final hold that I couldn't get to, I was going back and forth touching the final hold with 1 hand and going back to the original hold and that went on for a long time. My whole body's muscles were screaming at me, my forearms were about to give out. I was holding onto dear life as I was sooo close to the finish line and my friends were cheering me on with the chant of **GYATT** I knew I had to muster up all that energy from them and every last ounce of strength I have to complete it.

With the *power of friendship* (its funny but its real), I managed to place both of my hands on the final hold and **grip** it, successfully conquering my first V2. Everything felt like a sudden standstill once I completed it. So peaceful, So quiet, So perfect that I instantly let go of my both hands. The fall to the cushion was a blur for others. But to me, it felt like an eternity. In that instant the fear of heights and falling just vanished. The build up of troubles, frustrations, burdens from life instantly dissolved and left behind a profound sense of peace and serenity.

### Afterthought

After writing out my experience and reading it, I feel like a mad man rambling. But hey it's what I love. I'll definitely go and rock climb more in the future. Gotta thank Jason for bringing introducing me to the beauty of rock climbing.

Update (03/25/2024)
- my forearms are absolutely destroyed
